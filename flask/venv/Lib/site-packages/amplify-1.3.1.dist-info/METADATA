        ________________________________________
        These Terms of Use stipulate the terms and conditions for the granting of licenses by Fixstars Amplify Corporation (“we”, “us”, “our”) to the User for use of Fixstars Amplify (“Service”), which provides Users with a software development environment and computational resources for solving mathematical optimization problems. There are two types of Service plans: the “Free plan” with certain restrictions on the scope of use, and the “Paid plan” with no such restrictions. Unless otherwise specified, these Terms apply to both plan types.
        Before using the Service, the User shall carefully read and agree to the entire text of these Terms of Use.

## About Fixstars Amplify

Fixstars Amplify SDK is a middleware library for Ising machines developed by Fixstars Amplify Corporation. Ising machines specialize in solving optimization problems described by quadratic polynomials of binary variables. Various types of Ising machines implemented with digital circuits and GPUs have been released, starting with the quantum annealing machine by D-Wave Systems.
